# Data Mining and Machine Learning @ CEID

### Technologies
NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, scikit-learn, Pytorch, pgmpy, SciPy, Seaborn

### Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Trondheim (HARTH)
The HARTH dataset, contains data collected from two accelerometers worn by 22 participants in a study. The data collection lasted approximately 2 hours in a free-movement environment.<br/>
Performed an initial assessment of the data, followed by classification based on activity using 
- Neural Network implemented in PyTorch,
- Random Forest from scikit-learn,
- Bayesian Networks in pgmpy & Bayesian Classifier from scikit-learn.<br/>

Afterward, K-Means clustering was applied to group the data according to the detected activities.
